Okay so we gotta get this done, here's what I got cookin up

What we have currently:
- A kernel module that reads key presses and sends messages to a file
- A listener daemon that will read what the driver does and execute userspace commands accordingly

...holy bingus those 2 took too long to get working

OKAY!

What we need:
- keyboard shortcuts (multiple keys at once)
- a gui
- a config file to pass to our driver

The idea:

We basically make a config file that interfaces with our kernel module directly,
We then have a GUI that will modify the config file, as well as allowing the user to save changes and load the driver via command execution
GUI will run in userspace, along with the listener to make things secure.
